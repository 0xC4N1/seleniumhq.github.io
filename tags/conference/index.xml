&lt;p>As many of you know, the &lt;a href="https://seleniumconf.com">Selenium Conference&lt;/a> returns to an in-person event next March 28-30, 2023 in Chicago, IL. The Program Chairs &amp;amp; Committee, as well as the Extended Program Review Committee, have been hard at work putting together an outstanding lineup of speakers and workshops, and we&amp;rsquo;re close to releasing the full agenda and a completely re-branded conference website - stay tuned! In the meantime, we wanted you to be among the first to know who will be presenting, announce a new, additional pre-conference workshop, and provide you with some important updates. Here we go!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="keynote-sessions">Keynote Sessions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There will be four plenary keynote presentations across the 2-day conference. Selenium Core Committer &lt;strong>Diego Molina&lt;/strong> will open the conference on Wednesday with the &amp;ldquo;Selenium: State of the Union&amp;rdquo; presentation, followed by Quality &amp;amp; Leadership Coach &lt;strong>Erika Chestnut&lt;/strong> presenting &lt;a href="https://confengine.com/conferences/selenium-conference-chicago-2023/proposal/17864/bigger-than-the-box">&amp;ldquo;Bigger Than The Box&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, where she shares how she has crossed the aisles to elevate and expand the role quality in the organizations that she has worked for. Day 2 kicks off with &lt;strong>Mark Winteringham&lt;/strong>, Ministry of Testing OpsBoss, presenting &lt;a href="https://confengine.com/conferences/selenium-conference-chicago-2023/proposal/17865/what-exactly-do-you-do-in-test-automation">&amp;ldquo;What Exactly Do You Do In Test Automation&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. The final keynote session will be a &lt;strong>Q&amp;amp;A with the Selenium Committers&lt;/strong> panel.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="new-workshop-added---state-model-based-testing-using-selenium">New Workshop Added - State Model-Based Testing Using Selenium&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce a new addition to the optional pre-conference workshop day, &lt;a href="https://seleniumconf.com/state-model-based-testing-using-selenium-workshop/">State Model-Based Testing Using Selenium&lt;/a>, led by &lt;strong>Ru Cindrea&lt;/strong>, Managing Partner and Senior Test Consultant, Altom Consulting &amp;amp; &lt;strong>Alex Rotaru&lt;/strong>, Co-owner, Altom Consulting. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet heard of State Model-Based Testing (SMBT) is a testing technique that allows testers to visualize their applications and to generate and automate test flows by using different models of the application under test, thus obtaining a large number of test scenarios. When certain paths of the application are changed, the benefit of using SMBT is that you will only have to modify the states and transitions that apply to that change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This workshop rounds out the core pre-conference workshop offerings, which include a &lt;a href="https://seleniumconf.com/selenium-deep-dive-workshop/">Selenium Deep Dive&lt;/a> session led by Selenium Project Core Committer, &lt;strong>Titus Fortner&lt;/strong>; &lt;a href="https://seleniumconf.com/selenium-grid-4-workshop/">Driving Observability with Selenium Grid 4&lt;/a>, led by &lt;strong>Manoj Kumar&lt;/strong>, VP, Developer Relations at LambdaTest and Selenium Project Leadership Committee member, and &lt;a href="https://seleniumconf.com/advanced-appium-workshop/">Advanced Appium 2.0&lt;/a>, with &lt;strong>Srini Sekar&lt;/strong> &amp;amp; &lt;strong>Sai Krishna&lt;/strong>, Lead Consultants at Thoughtworks and long-time Appium workshop instructors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Workshops are one of the most popular offerings at any SeleniumConf and because class sizes are limited they invariably sell-out. Early Bird ticket sales have closed, but you can still find openings for any of these awesome day-long sessions. &lt;a href="https://seleniumconf.com/register/">Register today&lt;/a> and make sure you get a seat at the Conference + Workshop session of your choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wait-wait---where-is-the-fix-a-bug-become-a-committer-workshop">Wait, Wait - Where is the Fix a Bug, Become a Committer Workshop?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re a long-time follower of past Selenium Conferences, or just happened to attend the July, 2022 virtual SeleniumConf, you may be familiar with the long-standing workshop offering &lt;a href="https://confengine.com/conferences/selenium-conf-2022/proposal/16832/fix-a-bug-become-a-committer">&amp;ldquo;Fix a Bug, Become a Committer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. This workshop is a bit different in that the goal is to both enhance your own Selenium experience while offering the ability to contribute back to the project. With this, it&amp;rsquo;s not a learning session, per se, but more of a doing session, and we thought we&amp;rsquo;d take a different approach this time and make it available at no-charge (other than buying a conference ticket) to a limited number of applicants. More details and a link to the application to follow, but if you are familiar with Selenium and want to extend your conference experience an extra day we encourage you to apply. Scholarship applicants (more below) are also welcome to apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="announcing-the-seleniumconf-chicago-2023-scholarship-program">Announcing the SeleniumConf Chicago 2023 Scholarship Program&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The mission of the Selenium project is to educate the QA and developer communities about Selenium, the importance of quality assurance, and automated testing in general. Both the Selenium project and the SeleniumConf organizers very much want everyone to be able to attend the conference, but we know that not everyone’s personal or financial circumstances make this possible - so, we&amp;rsquo;re setting aside a number of free tickets, and covering travel expenses, as part of our SeleniumConf Chicago 2023 scholarship program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The program aims to support individuals from underrepresented groups in tech and those facing economic or social hardship so they have access to SeConf content and networking opportunities. If you’re an aspiring software professional looking to use Selenium, or a current one without access to the funds to buy your ticket, you should apply. We will award tickets to people who can show that the knowledge gained will be useful for their ongoing career. The application form will be posted in January, 2023.&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;d really like to see you next March in Chicago - so &lt;a href="https://seleniumconf.com/register/">register here&lt;/a>!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Selenium at Agile 2010</title><link>/blog/2010/selenium-at-agile-2010/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2010/selenium-at-agile-2010/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The Selenium project does not have an ‘official’ presence here at &lt;a href="http://agile2010.agilealliance.org">Agile&lt;/a> as it is seen as a ‘test after’ tool rather than ‘test first’ — even though it provides the magic of the ‘test first’ frameworks… But there is a small, unofficial contingent of recognizable faces around that can help people out and some sessions on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sessions&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
&lt;em>Why your selenium tests are so dang brittle, and what to do about it&lt;/em> – Wednesday, August 11 – 3:30 – 5:00&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are writing automated through-the-GUI tests for a web application, you are in danger of creating tests that are more expensive to maintain than they are worth. With well-factored Selenium RC tests running in Junit or TestNG, you can keep your abstraction layers or “Lingos” — small bounded bits of slang for discrete parts of the object model — separate, thereby reducing the maintenance costs of your tests, and improving your sanity. Prerequisites include experience with Java or C#, and ideally some *basic* OOD familiarity (inheritance, composition, encapsulation, polymorphism).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Selenium Open Jam&lt;/em> – Tuesday, August 10 – 11 – 12&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bring your questions or problems or complaints. We’ll try to ease / solve them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>People&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Dawn Cannan&lt;/em> – author of &lt;a href="http://www.passionatetester.com/">Confessions of a Passionate Tester&lt;/a> and maintainer of the .NET version of &lt;a href="http://github.com/marisaseal/selenesse">Selenesse&lt;/a> which is a bridge between Selenium and Fitnesse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Adam Goucher (me)&lt;/em> – maintainer of Selenium IDE and Selenium focused consultant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Jason Huggins&lt;/em> – creator of Selenium and co-founder of &lt;a href="http://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs&lt;/a> (Selenium in the cloud)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Patrick Wilson-Welsh&lt;/em> – Agile coach and Selenium power user&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you are not succeeding with Selenium, come track down one of us. We might redirect you somewhere else, but eventually we’ll get you sorted out.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
