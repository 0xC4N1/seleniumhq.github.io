We're very happy to announce the release of Selenium 4.4.0. We're shipping 
this for Java, .Net, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, so if you're using any 
of those languages, go and grab it from your package manager of choice!

Some of the main highlights are:

  * Adding support for CDP released in Chrome v104, while v101 was removed
  * Virtual authenticator feature was completed across languages.
  * All language bindings will throw an error when `w3c: false` is set in `ChromeOptions`
  * Improved health checks and requests with non W3C locators for Relay Nodes in Grid

Check the complete changelog and download the artifacts at the 
[Selenium 4.4.0 release in GitHub](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases/tag/selenium-4.4.0)
or directly from the [Selenium site][download].
