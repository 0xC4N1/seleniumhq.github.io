&lt;p>It’s with very great pleasure that &lt;strong>we are announcing the release of
Selenium 4&lt;/strong>. This is available for Java, .Net, Python, Ruby, and
Javascript. You can download it from your favourite package manager or
right &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases/tag/selenium-4.0.0">from GitHub&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re already a Selenium user, this update should be as easy as
just changing your dependency from 3.x to 4.0.0. We’ve worked hard to
ensure that this is a “drop-in” upgrade, having focused on keeping the
public APIs as stable as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, we’ve made changes, so if you relied on code that was
marked as internal to Selenium, or that was deprecated, you might
experience some hiccups. Please &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/getting_started/how_to_upgrade_to_selenium_4/">check our documentation&lt;/a> for
advice on how to deal with each of the common problems we’re aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there’s more to Selenium 4 than just being a stable release of
what was there before! It brings a whole host of new and exciting
features that we hope will make your tests more fun to write, and more
stable when you run them. Let’s take a look at some of them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ve introduced “&lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/locating_elements/#relative-locators">relative locators&lt;/a>”. These allow you to specify
where on the page an element can be found using language that people
use too; things like “above that element”, or “to the right of this
other element”. This will hopefully provide you all with a tool to
fight against incredibly complex locators, making your tests read a
little more clearly, and being more resilient to changes in the page’s
DOM. We’re not the first ones to come up with this idea &amp;ndash; that honour
belongs to &lt;a href="https://www.sahipro.com">Sahi&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; but if you’ve not used them before, we hope
you like them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re using &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/">Firefox&lt;/a> or a browser that is derived from
&lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium&lt;/a>, we’ve added a slew of new capabilities
too. These include ways of handling &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/bidirectional/chrome_devtools/bidi_api/#basic-authentication">“basic” and “digest”
authentication&lt;/a>, Network Interception (&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418">Are you an HTTP
418?&lt;/a>), and also performing commonly requested tasks, like
waiting for a &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/bidirectional/chrome_devtools/bidi_api/#mutation-observation">change in the DOM&lt;/a>, or providing a way to
look at &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/bidirectional/chrome_devtools/bidi_api/#javascript-exceptions">Javascript errors&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ve added these new features in a way that fits in with our existing
APIs. There’s no need to rewrite your tests: just use the new features
when it feels right to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also rebuilt the &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/">Selenium Grid&lt;/a>, taking lessons from
successful projects such as &lt;a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/zalenium/">Zalenium&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/">Selenoid&lt;/a> to enhance the capabilities. This new Grid runs
just as well as a single process, running on a single machine, as it
does in the traditional “hub and node” configuration, but it also
supports a fully-distributed mode, for use in modern infrastructure
running Kubernetes. It has better security baked-in, because we know
that securing a Grid can be a difficult task. And at all of these
scales and sizes, all the new features we’ve added to the language
bindings will work as expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Grid can also manage Docker containers on your local machine,
pulling images such as the &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/selenium">standalone firefox server&lt;/a> so your
infrastructure maintenance becomes just a little bit less taxing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the Grid is easier to manage. We’ve revamped the UI, placing
it on top of a GraphQL model that anyone is free to query and make use
of to create their own visualisations or monitors of the Grid. If
you’d like to peek into a running session, there are live VNC previews
you can open and interact with, providing even better insight into
what’s been going on. And if you want even more information, we’ve
integrated support for &lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry&lt;/a> into the Grid, so now you
can find out exactly what’s happening, where, and when.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know it’s a cliche to say that it’s a “very great pleasure”, but,
being honest with you, it genuinely is. Working on this new version of
Selenium has been a chance to work with some amazing engineers, and to
be part of a vibrant and energetic community. It’s been a lot of fun
to write this code, with these people, and it feels right to say
“thank you” to as many of them as possible here. So, without waiting
any longer&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We would like to thank all of our users who have helped Selenium be
successful over the years. Without you we wouldn’t be where we are
today. We would also like to thank all the contributors who have
submitted &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pulls">Pull Requests&lt;/a>, your contributions make Selenium better. For
everyone who’s taken the time to file an issue, and to let us know
where there’s been a problem: thank you. We only have a chance to
improve when we know that there’s something that needs work!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, thank you to all the Selenium Committers,
&lt;a href="https://www.browserstack.com/">BrowserStack&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs&lt;/a>, and our
&lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/sponsors/">Selenium-Level sponsors&lt;/a> for getting this release ready for
our users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We hope you enjoy Selenium 4, and we can’t wait to see what you do
with it!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Selenium 4 Release Candidate 2</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/selenium-4-rc-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/selenium-4-rc-2/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve listeneed and responded to the feedback from the first release
candidate of Selenium 4, and we&amp;rsquo;re now happy to announce the second
release candidate of Selenium 4. This is shipping for .Net, Java,
Python, Ruby, and Javascript, and it&amp;rsquo;s available from all the popular
package managers. Go! Try it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unless we encounter a very serious issue or bug, this is likely to be
the last release before we push Selenium 4.0.0 itself. What does this
mean for you? It&amp;rsquo;s your last chance to try it on for size and let us
know if there are any problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this release, we&amp;rsquo;ve fixed a nasty issue where closing the first
window would cause CDP-related features to break, and have landed a
few other cleanups and fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re a Firefox user, please make sure you&amp;rsquo;re using the very
latest version of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver&lt;/a> If you don&amp;rsquo;t, there may be
problems starting sessions as we rely on new features that are
included in this new geckodriver release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re new Selenium 4, then you may want to read this &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-new-tricks/">blog
post&lt;/a>, which explains more, but you might want to have a look at:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Relative locators, which provide a way of finding elements by
where they are in relation to one another (like &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;to
the right of&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authentication on websites using basic or digest authentication&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Network interception, which provides an easy easy way to capture
and modify HTTP traffic from the browser, as well as making it
possible to get HTTP status codes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Thank you to everyone in the community who&amp;rsquo;s given us so much helpful
and thoughtful feedback on the first release candidate. We really hope
that you enjoy this release candidate too!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One thing you may want to do to get ready for the update (which you
can do before updating the dependency itself!) is to update the

0.29.1 or later.&lt;/p>

but the main highlights are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Relative locators, for finding elements using terms that make

&lt;li>The ability to intercept network traffic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authentication with basic or digest authentication.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to announce the release of the first beta of Selenium
4. We&amp;rsquo;re shipping this for Java, .Net, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript,
so if you&amp;rsquo;re using any of those languages, go and grab it from your
package manager of choice!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has been the culmination of a lot of work by so many people, not
only the &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/project/structure/#tlc">project TLC&lt;/a>, but also of literally hundreds of people:
205 since we released Selenium 3.141.59, at the last count. A big
thank you to everybody who&amp;rsquo;s helped make this possible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what&amp;rsquo;s changed since Selenium 3? The answer is both &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>not much&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;
and also &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>almost everything&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>not much&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, I mean that if your tests are working with Selenium
3 right now, you should be able to just upgrade your dependency to
Selenium 4. You will find that things that were marked &amp;ldquo;deprecated&amp;rdquo;
are now gone, but the advantage of the long time between the last
Selenium 3 release and this is that you&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of time to try
and find alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, please let us know! We&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard to ensure
compatibility between the releases, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible we may have
missed some things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing you may want to do to get ready for the update (which you
can do before updating the dependency itself!) is to update the
drivers you need. In particular, please update &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver&lt;/a> to
0.29.0 or later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>almost everything&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, I mean that under the covers there have
been substantial changes. We&amp;rsquo;ve rewritten the Selenium server to allow
it to work not only in the familiar &amp;ldquo;standalone&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;hub and node&amp;rdquo;
modes, but also in a new &amp;ldquo;distributed&amp;rdquo; mode, which makes it
signifcantly easier to deploy to something such as Kubernetes in a way
that scales well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new server is also wired up with support for &lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry&lt;/a> and
exposes a &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-4.0.0-beta-1/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid/graphql/selenium-grid-schema.graphqls">GraphQL endpoint&lt;/a>, so that figuring what&amp;rsquo;s going
on in the Grid, and tracking down what&amp;rsquo;s gone wrong if something
happens, is easier than ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not all the changes are server-side. We recently wrote about the &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-new-tricks/">new
features in Selenium 4&lt;/a> that you can use in your tests, but some
of the main highlights are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Relative locators, for finding elements using terms that make
sense to us humans.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ability to intercept network traffic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authentication with basic or digest authentication.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll be telling you more about these features in later blog posts,
and as we improve our documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this sounds interesting, please download the beta from your
favourite package manager (maven, nuget, npm, pip, or the gem), or
directly from the &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/downloads">Selenium site&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: The Current Status of Selenium 1 and Selenium 2</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/the-current-status-of-selenium-1-and-selenium-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2010/the-current-status-of-selenium-1-and-selenium-2/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In the beginning there was Se1, and it was good. But it could have been better — in ways that WebDriver was starting to be good at. Thus the brilliant idea was hatched to merge the two projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then the confusion began. Let’s see if I can start to address some of it via a ficticious conversation that consolidates the Se-user list and #selenium irc channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>There are a couple annoying bugs in Se-RC 1.03; when is the 1.0.4 release?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Se-RC 1.0.4 is planned for sometime towards the end of July 2010&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I’ve heard rumours that 1.0.4 the to be the final release?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes. 1.0.4 is &lt;em>planned&lt;/em> on being the final 1.x release&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>That’s crazy talk! I can’t use a .0 or ‘alpha’ release for my mission critical application&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually, its not all &lt;em>that&lt;/em> crazy — and needs a bit more explanation. Se2 is truly a merger of the two projects, in fact 2.0a1 was literally the Se code from the OpenQA repository and the WebDriver code its Google Code repository merged into a &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium">new one&lt;/a>. This meant that from the first release of the 2.x series, it has contained 100% of the 1.x code which means 100% backwards compatibility. Later releases in the 2.x series have been driven primarily by evolutions of the code that came from WebDriver, &lt;em>not from Se 1.x&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OK, so 100% of Se 1.x is in 2.x; I get that. But how are you making sure that fixes to one get into the other?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is another ‘secret’ — don’t tell anyone, but there hasn’t been any pure 1.x development since the merging of the codebases. Every 1.x release since the merger has really been a 2.x release — but all packaged up to make it look like a 1.x release. This is why observant people have noticed a log message that looks something like &lt;em>11:09:37.507 INFO – v2.0 [a4], with Core v2.0 [a4]&lt;/em> when they start up their 1.x server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>So you’ve been releasing &lt;em>alpha&lt;/em> code disguised as a stable release? Jerks!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woah! Relax! Recall what I said above about it being backwards compatible by default. The ‘alpha’ tag is there because the API for the new code is still being developed and features flushed out. The 1.x code is however, still stable and still production quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Alright, I take back calling you folks jerks, but I really don’t like the alpha tag. When will it be out of ‘alpha’?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is only one or two more features to implement (like handling alerts) in the WebDriver code and some cleanup before the betas start. But hope for a 2.0.0 final by the end of the year. And while we’re on the topic of ‘alpha’ vs. ‘beta’, this the team’s working definitions of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Alpha&lt;/em> – APIs can, and likely will change. Possibly in dramatic ways.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Beta&lt;/em> – With the APIs set, make sure they work with the major browsers&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>‘Major Browsers’ eh, what exactly does that mean?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right now it means Firefox, Internet Explorer and at least one WebKit based one (Safari or Chrome)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short… it is a requirement of Se2 that the server be backwards compatible with Se-RC 1.x and that has already been accomplished by building the code from a common source repository. This means that if you are using Se-RC, you can switch out the server for a 2.x one and have no impact on the execution of the scripts. &lt;em>Plus&lt;/em> you can start to experiment with the new stuff that came over from WebDriver.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
