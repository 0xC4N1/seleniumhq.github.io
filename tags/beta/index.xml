We&amp;rsquo;re shipping this for Java, .Net, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, so if you&amp;rsquo;re using any of those languages, go and grab it from your package manager of choice!
This has been the culmination of a lot of work by so many people, not only the project TLC, but also of literally hundreds of people: 205 since we released Selenium 3.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 3 is Coming</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</guid><description>Selenium 3 is coming! As I write this, we think that ‚Äúbeta 4‚Äù will be the last beta before the official 3.0 release. I‚Äôm here to tell you about what‚Äôs changed, and what impact this will have on your testing.
TL;DR: WebDriver users will just find bug fixes and a drop-in replacement for 2.x. Selenium Grid users will also find bug fixes and a simple update. The WebDriver APIs are now the only APIs actively supported by the Selenium project.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Selenium 3.0-beta1</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/announcing-selenium-3-0-beta1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2016/announcing-selenium-3-0-beta1/</guid><description>At SeleniumConf in 2013, we announced that a new major version of Selenium would be released ‚Äúby Christmas‚Äù. Fortunately, we never said which Christmas, as it has taken us a while to make all the changes we wanted to make! We‚Äôre excited to announce the release of the first beta ‚Äî Selenium 3.0.0-beta1.
We‚Äôd love you to try it out on your projects, and provide us with feedback on where the rough edges are before we ship the 3.</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.0rc3: The ‚ÄúNext One‚Äôs The Big One‚Äù Release</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc3-the-next-ones-the-big-one-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc3-the-next-ones-the-big-one-release/</guid><description>When we pushed the 2.0rc1 live, we really hoped that the next release would be 2.0 final. We very quickly got some feedback that encouraged us to push a 2.0rc2. Now, after just under three weeks, we‚Äôre launching a third and final release candidate. You can download it from the Selenium HQ site or directly from Google Code.
We think we‚Äôve addressed many of the common issues, added some polish and added a host of bug fixes and minor changes, and we hope to hear your feedback!</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.0rc2: The Better Working Release</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc2-the-better-working-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc2-the-better-working-release/</guid><description>You win some and you lose some. We‚Äôd been really pleased to get Selenium 2.0rc1 out, so we were pretty disappointed to hear that some of you were running into problems with the Java version of the IE driver not launching IE sometimes. That‚Äôs definitely not good, so we fixed the problems and have released Selenium 2.0rc2. It‚Äôs the same as rc1, but with fewer problems üôÇ
We‚Äôre still very keen to hear your feedback!</description></item><item><title>Selenium 2.0rc1: The Grid Release</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc1-the-grid-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc1-the-grid-release/</guid><description>We‚Äôre very happy to announce the first Release Candidate for Selenium 2, available for Java, C#, Ruby and Python.
