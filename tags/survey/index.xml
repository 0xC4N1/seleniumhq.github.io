Batteries included Browser Management Unsurprisingly, people find having to manage browsers a task they wish they didn’t have to do and wish that Selenium did this. 59.5% of respondents want Selenium to manage the browsers for them. This, though the question didn’t ask this, is to include the browser drivers.
Frameworks The results show an interesting view into framework usage.</description></item><item><title>A Quick Survey on Features</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/a-quick-survey-on-features/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2011/a-quick-survey-on-features/</guid><description>Rather than surprising the general community in ways that we have become somewhat known for, I figured I would try something new. Actually asking about usage of things before changing them in fundamental ways.
To this end, I have created a quick(!) survey about changes that are under consideration regarding UI-Maps and how Se-IDE is opened.
The survey is only two questions, so I’m hoping for a large response. I’ll post the results next Monday (August 8, 2011).</description></item></channel></rss>
