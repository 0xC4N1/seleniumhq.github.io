Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium, so all capabilities and options
found on the [Chrome page]({{< ref "chrome.md" >}}) works for Edge as well.

Additionally, Microsoft Edge can be driven in "Internet Explorer Compatibility Mode" â€” 
read the [Internet Explorer page]({{< ref "internet_explorer.md" >}}) for more details.
