&lt;p>Yesterday, 19 May 2021, all the staff of Freenode, the IRC network, &lt;a href="https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt">collectively
resigned as staff because of what they felt was a hostile takeover&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Freenode has always been seen as the home of Free and Open Software, so
it was natural that you could find us on the #selenium channel there. To maintain this openness, and inclusivity,
we are moving our IRC Channel over to &lt;a href="https://libera.chat">Libera.chat&lt;/a>. It is has been created
by the team that previously maintained Freenode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are in the process of moving our Slack-to-IRC bridge over and hopefully the matrix bridge will be created
soon so that we can have a free and inclusive project on the new IRC Servers. There may be a few
hiccups so if you could bear with us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/automatedtester">twitter&lt;/a>
or on one of the &lt;a href="https://selenium.dev/support">chat protocols&lt;/a> we support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, thank you to &amp;ldquo;Milen from Bulgaria&amp;rdquo; for helping secure the channel for us on &lt;a href="https://libera.chat">Libera.chat&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
