&lt;p>It doesn’t seem that long ago that we announced on the mailing list that the Selenium project planned to join the &lt;a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy&lt;/a>. I’m very pleased to announce that as of Friday, 21st January, our application was approved. We’re now under the aegis of the SFC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From most people’s perspective, this won’t make much difference: you’ll still be able to view the documentation and download the latest versions of Selenium from &lt;a href="http://seleniumhq.org">Selenium HQ&lt;/a>. Development will continue to use &lt;a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/">Google Code’s&lt;/a> code hosting and issue tracking. We are now, however, part of a formal non-profit organization, which means that a number of issues, such as how to handle revenues from adverts on our sites, become clearer and more transparent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are more details about what this means in the &lt;a href="http://sfconservancy.org/news/2011/feb/02/selenium-joins/" title="Selenium Joins the Software Freedom Conservancy">SFC’s announcement&lt;/a> and their list of &lt;a href="http://sfconservancy.org/members/services/" title="SFC Member Project Services">membership benefits&lt;/a>. The bottom line is that this is a major milestone in Selenium’s growth and ensures that as we continue to grow our user base and introduce new features and projects, we’ll have strong support and backing from a well-respected Open Source organization.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
