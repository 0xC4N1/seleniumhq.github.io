&lt;p>In real estate, the mantra for finding a new house or office space is
&amp;ldquo;location, location, location!&amp;rdquo;.
It could be said that when working with Selenium, a critical aspect of
writing tests is &amp;ldquo;locators, locators, locators!&amp;rdquo;.
Having a robust locator strategy - in your app under test and in
your test framework - is highly important for effective testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are a Pythonista like myself and using Selenium for your test automation,
then there are some important changes coming to how locators are defined and used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometime after Selenium 4.2, the Python Selenium bindings will remove
locator-specific methods for finding elements. This means that the methods&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>will be removed. All of these methods are in fact special cases of&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#000">driver&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">find_element&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">By_object&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#4e9a06">&amp;#34;some_locator&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>so this approach is now preferred (required, even) with the Python bindings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that it&amp;rsquo;s good practice to use the
&lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver/selenium.webdriver.common.by.html#module-selenium.webdriver.common.by">By object&lt;/a>
which has specific values for using particular locator strategies. For example, this line&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#000">driver&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">find_element_by_id&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#4e9a06">&amp;#34;submit_button&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">click&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">()&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000">driver&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">find_element_by_css_selectors&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#4e9a06">&amp;#39;.myelement child&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">text&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>becomes&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#000">driver&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">find_element&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">By&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">ID&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#4e9a06">&amp;#34;submit_button&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">click&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">()&lt;/span>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re really desperate however you can use strings instead of the By object:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#000">driver&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">find_element&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#4e9a06">&amp;#39;id&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#4e9a06">&amp;#34;submit_button&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">click&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">()&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000">driver&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">find_element&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#4e9a06">&amp;#39;css selector&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#4e9a06">&amp;#39;.myelement child&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ce5c00;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000">text&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you have any plans to upgrade your Selenium client for your Python tests
to recent versions of Selenium 4, definitely keep these changes in mind.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good time to update your locator strategy and structure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With the retirement of Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) later this year, the folks in Redmond have helped the
Selenium project with getting IE Mode in Microsoft Edge working in IEDriver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IE 11 is due to retire on 15 June 2022 for certain versions of Windows 10. After this date, the Selenium project
recommends that you test your IE sites with IE Mode in Microsoft Edge. The Selenium Project will not remove
support for IE 11 when it retires but we will not actively fix issues as we have done with previous versions of IE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Microsoft Edge team have committed to supporting IE Mode in Edge until 2029 when support for Windows 10 is retired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft have written up all the details on &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/new-testing-tools-to-help-prepare-for-ie-retirement/ba-p/3059947">how to use and how to migrate your site&lt;/a>
and we recommend you go read and follow their steps to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re ready.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Improving &amp; refining our Docs translations</title><link>/blog/2021/docs-translations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/docs-translations/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A while ago, we started to make the Selenium &lt;a href="/documentation">documentation&lt;/a> available in more
languages. This, in an effort to offer a more inclusive environment for Selenium users who do
not have English as their mother tongue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This effort grew organically, and we got many pull requests adding content for different
languages. Over time, some translations got to a very good state, and others didn&amp;rsquo;t get much
attention. This brought the situation where 9 different languages are available in the
documentation, but only a few add value to the readers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To understand which languages are getting visits, we started using
&lt;a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible&lt;/a>. After a few weeks, we combined the information collected
by the analytics tool with the translated percentage per language, and we got the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the number of visitors on the landing page for a given translation in the past 2 weeks,
and the percent of documentation pages translated:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Language&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Visitors&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Translated&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>ja&lt;/td>
&lt;td>1,700&lt;/td>
&lt;td>86%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>zh-cn&lt;/td>
&lt;td>1,500&lt;/td>
&lt;td>86%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>es&lt;/td>
&lt;td>409&lt;/td>
&lt;td>42%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>fr&lt;/td>
&lt;td>203&lt;/td>
&lt;td>31%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>pt-br&lt;/td>
&lt;td>189&lt;/td>
&lt;td>87%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>de&lt;/td>
&lt;td>88&lt;/td>
&lt;td>65%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>ko&lt;/td>
&lt;td>79&lt;/td>
&lt;td>68%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>nl&lt;/td>
&lt;td>22&lt;/td>
&lt;td>6%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>This shows that the most used languages (aside from English) are Japanese and Chinese, and that
the language that has translated most of the content is Portuguese.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on this data, we decided to create a new role in the Selenium project:
&lt;a href="/project/structure/#docs_site_translators">translators&lt;/a>. This role will help the project
keep in shape the different translations available. Together with that, we are also putting
on hold the other available translations until we find volunteers for each language.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The short version is that I&amp;rsquo;m stepping down as the Selenium project
lead, and will concentrating on pushing WebDriver Bidi
forwards. Fortunately, the &lt;a href="/project/structure/#tlc">Selenium TLC&lt;/a> have already been
steering the project for a while now, so it&amp;rsquo;s in excellent hands. With
Selenium 4 now shipped, the project has a new energy and enthusiasm
about it. The future is bright, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what
it holds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The longer version? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s more personal. Let me start at the
beginning&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the 3rd January, 2007 I pushed the &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/commit/29393a759063a0ea7a2d05c9592d687c4b6438a9">initial commit&lt;/a> of
&amp;ldquo;WebDriver&amp;rdquo; to a public repo. I helped with the Selenium 1.0 release,
and at the same time made sure that WebDriver emulated the original
Selenium RC APIs (in code that lives on to this day). In 2009, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hugs">Jason
Huggins&lt;/a> and I &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Vlz-WmcrBL8">merged the Selenium and WebDriver
projects&lt;/a>, and I took over the leadership of the
project. I&amp;rsquo;ve been the lead for every version of Selenium since then,
often being the person who tagged each release in source control, all
the way up to the recent Selenium 4 release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the numbers, that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>14 years of WebDriver&lt;/li>
&lt;li>12 years of Selenium for me
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Though the first Selenium commits were in 2004&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 &lt;a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/insights/blog/happy-10th-birthday-selenium">10 year birthday celebration&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Approximately 130 Selenium releases.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;ve landed just over 5100 commits
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Which is about 20% of all the changes made to Selenium over the
years.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 different source control systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 build systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>14 Selenium conferences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>696 different people contributing to the project.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In a way, I blame Michael C for this. He and I worked together at
ThoughtWorks in Australia, and had been working with
&lt;a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net">HttpUnit&lt;/a>. My assertion was that its API was fine. His was
that it should be more &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-Oriented&lt;/a>. To explore the idea, I
started writing an OO wrapper around HttpUnit, and (of course!)
Michael was right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/joewalnes">Joe Walnes&lt;/a> who I should be talking
about. At about the same, he&amp;rsquo;d been exploring a similar kind of
design, but where my API had a &lt;code>Browser&lt;/code>, his had the far better
sounding &lt;code>WebDriver&lt;/code>, and he was generous enough to allow me to use
the same name in my next iteration of the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or, perhaps, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://paulhammant.com">Paul Hammant&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks&lt;/a>. Paul was the
one who suggested Open Sourcing what was then &amp;ldquo;WebDriver&amp;rdquo; under the
Apache 2 license, and ThoughtWorks supported the decision to make the
code available to the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, on that day in 2007, I was sitting on the sofa with a
glass of red wine, creating the project on &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/archive/">Google Code&lt;/a>,
and thinking (if I was thinking deeply at all) that it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to
get the code out there, and in six months it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be
over. There was absolutely no way I could dream that the project would
grow far beyond me, emerging from the &lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2019/february/the-cambrian-explosion-was-far-shorter-than-thought.html">Cambrian explosion&lt;/a>
of the early days of web testing to become first an industry-wide de
facto standard, and then, through the work done in the W3C, an &lt;a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/">actual
standard&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s the only browser automation API that all the
browser vendors support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During these past 14 years, Selenium has been one of the constants of
my life. I joke sometimes that I&amp;rsquo;ve known it longer than my wife and
my son, but is it a joke if it&amp;rsquo;s true?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why spend that much time and effort on Open Source? On something that
you give away for free? Because it&amp;rsquo;s just been so incredibly
rewarding. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to meet people from all over the globe,
work with amazing people from a range of companies I&amp;rsquo;d never have a
chance of working with normally, learn and practice skills I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have had a chance to exercise, and to write code that makes people&amp;rsquo;s
lives just a little bit easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most importantly, Selenium has been the way that I&amp;rsquo;ve met some of the
best friends I have in my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very lucky.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also been lucky to have met and been part of the Selenium
community. The conferences and meetups have been a fantastic way to
hear about how people are using the tool, and I am constantly
impressed by how inventive and thoughtful people can be. The
conversations I&amp;rsquo;ve had at those events have changed how I think about
all sorts of things, and not just code. The IRC and Slack channels are
vibrant and interesting places to be. There are folks who are there
regularly who I&amp;rsquo;ve never met in person, but who I feel I could count
as friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who knew that Open Source could be the source of so much that makes a
life bright?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But today, I&amp;rsquo;m stepping down as the project lead, and will be away
from the project until summer, though (in the true spirit of this
project), I’m not sure which year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why, if all I said above is true, am I stepping down?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The major reason is that the things I like to do, and that I&amp;rsquo;m good
at, are not the things that the project needs right now. It would be
hubris to believe that no-one else could do as good a job,
particularly when I know how amazing so many people on the project
are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other reason is that I&amp;rsquo;m tired. For the past 14 years, much of my
free time, as well as hours within work, has been spent working on
Selenium. There are other projects and interests I&amp;rsquo;d like to pour some
energy into (just ask me how my Turkish lessons are going!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my absence, the project&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="/project/structure/#tlc">Technical Leadership Committee&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;
will continue to be setting the direction of the project. I&amp;rsquo;ve been
listening to the discussions about where the project can go: it&amp;rsquo;s
going to be brilliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is, while I&amp;rsquo;m stepping down, the rest of the TLC will be stepping
up. They&amp;rsquo;ve already been running the project for a while. They’ll
continue the work we’ve started and carry it forwards and upwards. If
you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, and want to get involved, step in and &lt;a href="/support/#ChatRoom">join the
fun&lt;/a>. Now&amp;rsquo;s the perfect time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I took over as lead of the Selenium project, Paul joked that he
had thrown me the keys and run in the opposite direction. I guess it’s
my turn to do that now!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before finishing, I&amp;rsquo;d just like to say a heartfelt &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; to
everyone who&amp;rsquo;s been involved in the Selenium project. To everyone
who&amp;rsquo;s contributed in some way, or used the code we&amp;rsquo;ve written, thank
you. To everyone who&amp;rsquo;s filed a bug, thank you too. To all the people
who I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of so many conversations with, that I would
never have met without Selenium, thank you. To my family, who’ve
supported me and understood with endless patience that Selenium is a
part of our lives, thank you. And to my friends on the project, an
extra meaningful thank you.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to announce the first release candidate of Selenium
4. We&amp;rsquo;re shipping this for .Net, Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript,
so if you&amp;rsquo;re using any of those languages, go and grab it from your
package manager of choice!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release is the result of a lot of work by the Selenium team
project, but most importantly, all the Selenium community who
tried our beta releases, and gave us great and valuable feedback.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One thing you may want to do to get ready for the update (which you
can do before updating the dependency itself!) is to update the
drivers you need. In particular, please update &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver&lt;/a> to
0.29.1 or later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the new features in Selenium 4 are mentioned in this &lt;a href="/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-new-tricks/">blog entry&lt;/a>,
but the main highlights are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Relative locators, for finding elements using terms that make
sense to us humans.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ability to intercept network traffic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authentication with basic or digest authentication.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If this sounds interesting, please download the release candidate from your
favourite package manager (maven, nuget, npm, pip, or the gem), or
directly from the &lt;a href="/downloads">Selenium site&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: All Selenium downloads are now available on GitHub releases</title><link>/blog/2021/downloads-now-on-github-releases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/downloads-now-on-github-releases/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We announced on a previous &lt;a href="/blog/2021/downloads-moving-to-github-releases/">entry&lt;/a> our
decision to move all binaries from &lt;a href="https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html">Google Storage&lt;/a>
to &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases">GitHub releases&lt;/a>. Today, we would like to
announce that this work has been completed and all binaries are also available to be downloaded
in each one of the releases we have done in GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to that, all links on our &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/">downloads&lt;/a> page
have been updated, as well as all references to Google Storage in the Selenium code base.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note that all past releases will be available both in Google Storage and GitHub releases,
but new ones will only be present in GitHub releases. We recommend everyone to modify your
download scripts to keep all tooling up to date.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Google, &lt;a href="https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html">Google Storage&lt;/a>
has been the central place where we have been able to upload all binaries created for each
Selenium release, and the place where the Selenium community can download them from. To do so,
all people needed to do was visit our &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/">downloads&lt;/a> page,
find the release, and download from there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Selenium project hosts its source code on GitHub, and people who are familiar with GitHub
know that they can go to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases">&amp;ldquo;release&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> page
there to find any downloads for each release of a project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rather than hosting the downloads in two places, the Selenium project has decided to host
everything on GitHub. We&amp;rsquo;ll still have links from the download page, but rather than pointing
to Google Storage, these will now point to the downloads for each corresponding release tagged
on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All past releases will be available both in Google Storage and GitHub releases, but new ones
will only be present in GitHub releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are a watcher of the Selenium &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium">repo&lt;/a>, please note
that there will be some noise in your inboxes. We need to create releases for old tags in order
to upload the binaries to the release (as is the way GitHub releases work), and we expect to
complete this in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have any questions or comments, please reach out through any of all the available options

&lt;p>We have been working hard during the last few weeks redoing our
&lt;a href="//selenium.dev">website&lt;/a>. Today, we are very happy to share it
with the community and we are hoping to get as much feedback as
possible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We did a major revamp to our website two years ago. However, this
revamp had some &amp;ldquo;technical debt&amp;rdquo; in it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&amp;#39;re happy to announce that we have (finally!) refreshed our site.

&lt;p>We use &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> to generate our website, and to
build a website with Hugo, one normally needs to select a
&lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo theme&lt;/a>. Our previous website was
being built using two different Hugo themes, which was less than
ideal. Having two Hugo themes was hard to maintain and accepting
contributions was tricky in some cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This new website version is using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/docsy">Docsy&lt;/a>
theme, made by some folks at Google and used by other popular projects
such as &lt;a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes&lt;/a>. Using Docsy helps us to focus
more on the website&amp;rsquo;s content rather than spending lots of time
maintaining the underlying details of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all hope you will like the new look and please check our
&lt;a href="/documentation/about/contributing/">contribution guidelines&lt;/a> if
you want to contribute to the Selenium website.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday, 19 May 2021, all the staff of Freenode, the IRC network, &lt;a href="https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt">collectively
resigned as staff because of what they felt was a hostile takeover&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Freenode has always been seen as the home of Free and Open Software, so
it was natural that you could find us on the #selenium channel there. To maintain this openness, and inclusivity,
we are moving our IRC Channel over to &lt;a href="https://libera.chat">Libera.chat&lt;/a>. It is has been created
by the team that previously maintained Freenode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are in the process of moving our Slack-to-IRC bridge over and hopefully the matrix bridge will be created
soon so that we can have a free and inclusive project on the new IRC Servers. There may be a few
hiccups so if you could bear with us.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to announce the release of the first beta of Selenium
4. We&amp;rsquo;re shipping this for Java, .Net, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript,
so if you&amp;rsquo;re using any of those languages, go and grab it from your
package manager of choice!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has been the culmination of a lot of work by so many people, not
only the &lt;a href="/structure/#tlc">project TLC&lt;/a>, but also of literally hundreds of people:
205 since we released Selenium 3.141.59, at the last count. A big
thank you to everybody who&amp;rsquo;s helped make this possible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what&amp;rsquo;s changed since Selenium 3? The answer is both &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>not much&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;
and also &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>almost everything&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>not much&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, I mean that if your tests are working with Selenium
3 right now, you should be able to just upgrade your dependency to
Selenium 4. You will find that things that were marked &amp;ldquo;deprecated&amp;rdquo;
are now gone, but the advantage of the long time between the last
Selenium 3 release and this is that you&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of time to try
and find alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, please let us know! We&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard to ensure
compatibility between the releases, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible we may have
missed some things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing you may want to do to get ready for the update (which you
can do before updating the dependency itself!) is to update the
drivers you need. In particular, please update &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver&lt;/a> to
0.29.0 or later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>almost everything&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, I mean that under the covers there have
been substantial changes. We&amp;rsquo;ve rewritten the Selenium server to allow
it to work not only in the familiar &amp;ldquo;standalone&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;hub and node&amp;rdquo;
modes, but also in a new &amp;ldquo;distributed&amp;rdquo; mode, which makes it
signifcantly easier to deploy to something such as Kubernetes in a way
that scales well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new server is also wired up with support for &lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry&lt;/a> and
exposes a &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-4.0.0-beta-1/java/server/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid/graphql/selenium-grid-schema.graphqls">GraphQL endpoint&lt;/a>, so that figuring what&amp;rsquo;s going
on in the Grid, and tracking down what&amp;rsquo;s gone wrong if something
happens, is easier than ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not all the changes are server-side. We recently wrote about the &lt;a href="/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-new-tricks/">new
features in Selenium 4&lt;/a> that you can use in your tests, but some
of the main highlights are:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>The ability to intercept network traffic&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll be telling you more about these features in later blog posts,
and as we improve our documentation.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the fourth and final post in his series, Simon Stewart continues talking about what&amp;rsquo;s
coming in Selenium 4 and reviews what&amp;rsquo;s new in the Selenium Grid.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We’ve covered a lot of ground in the past few blog posts, including how to contribute to the project, and some
details of what you can expect as a Selenium user. But there’s more to Selenium than just the APIs you use to write
your tests, and one of the big features we’ve not covered yet is the refreshed Selenium Grid: a mechanism that
allows you to distribute your tests across a fleet of machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before going further, it’s always nice to acknowledge where we’ve come from, not only because it’s interesting, but
also because it helps explain the “why” of the refreshed design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Way back in the mists of time (2008), Jennifer Bevin and Jason Huggins worked on a system called the Selenium Farm
at Google. This was a fleet of machines sitting in a cupboard somewhere that allowed you to run the original
Selenium protocol. This was, of course, at Google scale, so there was more than one cupboard :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allowed people at Google to distribute their tests and scale out beyond their individual machines.
This was such a great idea that when Jennifer talked about the Farm at a Selenium meetup, Philippe
Haringou (then at ThoughtWorks) decided to write an Open Source implementation of the same thing,
which he called “Selenium Grid”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Selenium Grid was a lovely piece of technology, but it had one drawback: it only spoke the original
Selenium RC protocol. That was fine, but WebDriver spoke a different wire protocol, which was called the
JSON Wire Protocol, and folks wanted to be able to use both Selenium RC and WebDriver at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where Francois Reynaud enters the picture. He was working at eBay, reporting to Michael Palotas,
and he had written something like the original Selenium Grid, but which also worked with the JSON Wire
Protocol. They very kindly contributed that work to the Selenium project, and it formed the basis of the
Selenium Grid 2. We decided at the time that the Selenium standalone server would effectively be a
“grid of one”: it would have everything you needed in it to set up a Selenium Grid, as well as to work as
a single standalone server. Merging the code and getting it stable took a while, but thanks to the efforts
of Francois, Kristian Rosenvold, and many others, we merged Grid 2 into the main Selenium project and shipped
Selenium 2 in 2011.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if 2011 doesn’t feel that long ago, the modern world has changed quite significantly. In 2011, we didn&amp;rsquo;t
have Docker. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have Kubernetes, we didn&amp;rsquo;t really have AWS. So, the Selenium Grid didn&amp;rsquo;t know that those
things were coming in, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t written to take advantage of them. Fortunately, we did have virtual machines
back then, and the Grid 2 had been designed to be able to support them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the hook that an excellent project called Zalenium. Developed by Diego Molina, Zalenium added a really
nice UI and support for Docker and Kubernetes—all built on top of the Grid 2. This has allowed the Selenium Grid to
continue to be relevant and useful to this day, which is an amazing achievement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, like I said, it took us time to stabilise Grid 2: about six months of hard work, largely led by Kristian.
That’s because while Grid 2 was sophisticated, the code was hard to read and hard to maintain—and very few people
could do that. Worse, the merging of the Grid 2 and the original Selenium server was pretty crude; effectively
there were two separate servers shipped in the same binary. This led to problems occurring in the Grid but not
when run in standalone mode, and vice versa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Selenium 4 we’ve decided to bite the bullet and address these three concerns. Firstly, we want something that
was easier to work on and maintain. Secondly, we want to merge the servers into a single unit. Thirdly, we want
something that will take advantage of the world of modern infrastructure we have available to us now, not just in
the form of Docker and Kubernetes, but also to be able to use emerging technologies such as distributed tracing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this, we looked at the functionality the Grid provided, and to model each piece as a component that we can
either run “in memory” (allowing us to have a single standalone server), or in a more distributed way, allowing
the “hub and node” architecture that we’re familiar with from the original Selenium Grid, to a fully distributed
design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first component is the “router”. It serves as the entry point to the Grid. You can expose it to the internet
and it directs requests to the Grid. It’s designed to be stateless, and so you can add more to Grid as you find
you need to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the router sees a new session request, it places it on a “session queue.” The session queue is read by a
component called the “distributor,” which maintains a model of all the places in the Grid where a session could be
run: we call them “slots”. The slots are hosted by components called “nodes,” and each node can have one or more
slots. When the distributor pulls a new session request from the queue, it identifies the most appropriate slot
to use, and forwards the request to the node which owns the slot. Once the node has started the session, the
distributor puts the session ID and the URL of the Node that is running the test into the “session map”—you can
think of the session map as being a simple map of a session ID to URL—and the new session response is sent
back to the waiting test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Requests for running sessions (that is, for most webdriver calls!) are handled slightly differently. The router
will use the session map to look up which node to forward the request to, avoiding the need to involve the
distributor entirely. This means that you can just keep adding nodes to the Grid, and there are fewer bottlenecks
in the architecture to slow your requests down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conceptually, there are these five moving pieces within the Grid. But there&amp;rsquo;s actually a sixth one, which is a
message bus. The five Grid components communicate internally through the message bus, but the actual components
that you need to think about when you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about the Grid are the Router, Session Queue, Distributor, and
Nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you run Selenium Grid 4 in “standalone” mode, you actually get a “grid of one”. We wire up all these
components in a single process, but they’re all still there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also run it in the traditional Hub and Node approach that you&amp;rsquo;ve seen with Selenium Grid 2, where you
fire up a Hub and a Node and it registers. If you&amp;rsquo;ve used Selenium Grid recently, that&amp;rsquo;s probably the architecture
that you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with. In this case, most of the components (the router, session queue, and distributor) are
running in the Hub, and the Nodes run the sessions themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What’s new with Grid 4 is that you can go into a fully distributed mode if you want to. Typically, you would want
to use something like Kubernetes for this, and some of the key components are designed to store data using a
database or Redis for better reliability and scalability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something to note is that when running a distributed Grid, it becomes really difficult to figure out what is
happening, particularly when something goes wrong. To alleviate that problem, we have adopted Open Telemetry to
bring observability into the Grid. What do we mean by observability? It simply means that we want to be able to
see everything that happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we’d like to expose information about the running Grid in meaningful and useful ways. The original
Grid supported both JMX (a Java management API) and an HTML-based console. While nice, this didn’t make it easy
to query specific areas of the Grid that you might be interested in that weren’t surfaced by the UI (for example,
how many slots are available, or to find out which node a particular session is running on) To provide more
flexibility, we’ve chosen to provide a GraphQL endpoint for the Grid. To ensure that GraphQL endpoint is
sufficiently flexible, we’re building the new Grid console using it. That should allow you to also extract useful

&lt;p>Those are some highlights of the new Selenium Grid. What are you the most excited about?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Below is a summary of the Selenium survey that was collected.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="batteries-included">Batteries included&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="browser-management">Browser Management&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Unsurprisingly, people find having to manage browsers a task they wish they didn’t have to do and wish that Selenium did this. 59.5% of respondents want Selenium to manage the browsers for them. This, though the question didn’t ask this, is to include the browser drivers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="frameworks">Frameworks&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The results show an interesting view into framework usage. 61% of users use a framework. When we look closer at some of the responses there could be a little language bias in there. Some responses in the “both” category are “depends on the language” or “depends on the project”. Frameworks, from a couple responses seem to be around JavaScript mostly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-tests-are-run">How tests are run&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the questions that was the most surprising was that people dislike running their tests in headless. 57% of people don’t want headless. This is surprising since puppeteer and playwright are up and coming tools that default to headless.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="browsers">Browsers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People tend to favour evergreen, or the latest version from auto updating browsers, with over 55% of people wanting that. When we look at the data closer then people tend to do evergreen and then a specific version for IE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People are also, overwhelmingly I should add, wanting to test on multiple browsers. 78% of people test with multiple browsers. This goes against the Chrome only support that we see on social media. The most used browsers for testing are (Percentage of respondents testing with browser):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Google Chrome (98%)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Firefox (67%)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Microsoft Edge (33%)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Safari (29%)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>IE (13.5%)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One thing that is clear is that Testing against multiple browsers is hard. 51.6% say it’s hard and a further 27.3% being 3 out of 5. This is likely where some frameworks are becoming popular as it removes some of the need to understand the asynchronicity of browsers. This still has its problems in puppeteer and playwright as they add similar wait libraries to what Selenium has.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mobile-browsers">Mobile Browsers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the most surprising things to have come out of survey was the want to use mobile browsers more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of the 410 respondents 367 want to test on mobile. Interestingly, this goes well past just Chrome for Android and Safari for iOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is a list of browsers and percentage of users wanting to use it. Questions were designed for Android unless it said iOS. See note at the end of the section.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Firefox for Android: 38%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Chrome: 91%*&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Microsoft Edge: 14%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Samsung Internet: 16.6%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Safari on iOS: 69%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>*Note that the questionaire only mentioned Chrome so it could be a conflation between platforms here. 1 Person used the other field to add Chrome for iOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="language-support">Language support&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Language support is what one would suspect with most users using Java or python.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>java: 67%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>python: 31%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ruby: 6.1%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>.NET: 17.6%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>JavaScript: 21.4%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>PHP: 1.5%&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="improvements">Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After reviewing the “What one thing would you improve about Selenium I was able to narrow most of the responses down to similar types.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is a breakdown of the issues that people would like to see improved.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/blog/2021/breakdown_of_answers.png"
alt="Breakdown of answers of areas needing improvement. Main 3 areas are flakiness, documentation, Browser Management, Shadow DOM"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="happiness">Happiness&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Of the 410 respondents, 219 had something nice to say about Selenium and were thankful for the product being around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the main reasons are simplicity of APIs, good backwards compatibility, and it being open source&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: New Tricks in Selenium 4</title><link>/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-new-tricks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-new-tricks/</guid><description>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the third post in his series, Simon Stewart continues talking about what&amp;rsquo;s coming in
Selenium 4 and reviews some of the tricks in the new release.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In my last posts, we talked about
&lt;a href="/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-how-can-i-contribute">how to contribute to Selenium&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-why-the-major-version-bump">why we’re bumping the version number to 4&lt;/a>.
That’s enough preamble! Today, we’ll cover some details about the new tricks and capabilities
that Selenium 4 offers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finding-elements-and-relative-locators">Finding Elements, and Relative Locators&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You know, finding elements on a page can be really difficult. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen loads of people using
very complicated XPATH expressions, and trying to figure out complex CSS selectors and things
like that. There have been whole talks about the subject at SeleniumConf. Surely there must
be a better way to do this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about how we describe where an element is on the page. Think about how you’d do this
over the phone. You’d never talk about the raw DOM, “Ah, find the fifth DIV element nested
inside the SPAN with an ‘id’ of ‘foo’”. You’d just never say that! Instead, you’d say
something like, “just find that thing above that image, and to the right of that link,”
when talking about where things are located on the page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A long time ago, a project called &lt;a href="https://sahipro.com">Sahi&lt;/a> started to locate elements
like this. Sahi had &lt;a href="https://sahipro.com/docs/sahi-apis/accessor-api-basics.html#Use%20of%20Positional%20Relation%20APIs">Relation APIs&lt;/a>, which are a lovely way of finding elements,
and it was very, very fluent and pleasant to use. When I was starting WebDriver years ago,
I was talking with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/narayanraman">Narayan&lt;/a> (creator of Sahi) and I
promised him that I was going to hold off implementing this flagship feature of Sahi. It
was something that was lovely, but it was also something Sahi was rightly proud of. However,
there are now other tools, such as Tyco, that are implementing this style of API, so it
seems like the time is right to do the same in Selenium. In Selenium 4 we call them
“relative locators.” You may sometimes see us refer to them as “friendly locators,” since the
initial implementation called them that, but “relative” better describes how they work. We
have a handful of them: near, above, below, left of, right of. They allow you to talk in human
language about where an element is on a page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at the future, we are also planning to enable users to add new types of locators,
not only on the, on the client side, but also to the Selenium Server. For example, although
JS UI frameworks come and go (anyone else remember using jquery?), it’d be nice to be able
to add a custom locator for the current tools people like, such as React.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="authenticating-to-web-sites">Authenticating to Web Sites&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One feature that people have been asking for since we started the project has been the ability
to authenticate to a web site. Previously, you could do this by crafting the URL the browser
went to properly, but this leaks credentials to any man-in-the-middle and leaves them in server
logs, so browsers have slowly removed this piece of functionality. That’s unfortunate, since
it’s something that we know people frequently need to do in their tests. In Selenium 4, we
now offer a mechanism to register a username and password that can be used to authenticate against these sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="intercepting-network-traffic">Intercepting Network Traffic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A common complaint of Selenium tests is that they’re slow and flaky. While the bindings to the
browser are excellent, and fully described by the W3C WebDriver spec, it is true that any end-to-end
test is likely to suffer more flakiness than a simple unit test—there are just more moving parts,
and more possibilities for things to go wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way to resolve this issue is to stub out the backend of the application, intercepting network
traffic in the test and returning pre-canned responses. Tools such as &lt;a href="http://www.mbtest.org">mountebank&lt;/a>
make this easy for API testing. Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a similar tool for Selenium?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Selenium 4, we now provide a mechanism to do this, using the NetworkInterceptor (well, that’s
what we call it in the Java bindings). Pass it your WebDriver instance, and it’ll be called every time
the browser is about to make an HTTP request, allowing you to return almost anything you want&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-chrome-debugging-protocol">The Chrome Debugging Protocol&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I mentioned previously, one of the nice things about Selenium 4 is our work to ensure a stable
and modern user-facing API. What does this mean? To start, we need to acknowledge that after a long
time there’s now competition back in the browser automation space. Notably in the form of Puppeteer
and Cypress, and taking a step back, what do they offer? They build upon the
&lt;a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/">Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)&lt;/a>&amp;gt;, which is a
protocol developed to enable a debugger inside Chromium-based browsers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of what it was designed to do, it is a chatty protocol, and not a user-facing API that
allows you to introspect into the browser. Worse, introduce a network hop between the test and the
browser, this chattiness leads to slower tests as the network latency increases. That is why tools
such as Puppeteer want you to run on the local machine. That’s great for the speed of an individual
test, but makes parallelisation harder, as you can&amp;rsquo;t use services such as Sauce Labs easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To complicate matters, because the CDP is designed as a &lt;em>debugging&lt;/em> protocol, it can change with no
notice between versions. That’s why Puppeteer and Cypress are tied to specific versions of browsers,
and that causes a dilemma for you as a test author: how do you test on multiple versions of a browser?
Updating the test API to get a different browser can lead to you no longer making valid API calls.
Not doing so ties you to a potentially outdated version of a browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite this, using the CDP opens up a host of possibilities, and that’s why we’ve added support
for it in Selenium 4. In fact, some of our new features are built on top of it (though we hide the details!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we’ve also gone further that just adding basic support. Selenium 4 can support multiple versions
of the CDP at the same time, meaning you can test with both the current and beta versions of Chromium-based
browsers without needing to rewrite tests. We do this by providing an “idealised CDP”, which is
stable and covers the features we feel tests need. If that idealised view of the world isn’t enough
for you, we also expose the raw CDP APIs too, giving you flexibility to choose what’s best for your tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’re feeding this experience into the new W3C WebDriver Bidi specification, which is helping make that
a better fit for testers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am leaving out of this post all the details related to another important trick in Selenium 4, the new
Selenium Grid, which I will cover in the next post. Stay tuned!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This was originally posted at &lt;a href="https://saucelabs.com/blog/new-tricks-in-selenium-4">https://saucelabs.com/blog/new-tricks-in-selenium-4&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: What’s Coming in Selenium 4: Why The Major Version Bump?</title><link>/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-why-the-major-version-bump/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-why-the-major-version-bump/</guid><description>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the second post in this series, Simon Stewart continues talking about
what&amp;rsquo;s coming in Selenium 4 and why this release has a major version bump.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In my &lt;a href="/blog/2020/what-is-coming-in-selenium-4-how-can-i-contribute/">last post&lt;/a>,
I shared a bit about how the Selenium project works overall. Now, let’s start talking about Selenium 4
and what’s coming. One thing I think I should clear up is &amp;ldquo;why the major version number bump?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes I joke that the major reason for the version number bump is that while the digits of Pi are
infinite, when we went from 3.14 to 3.141, people got a little bit upset. Moving to 3.141.5 and then
3.141.59 was as far as we wanted to push that particular idea :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More seriously, the first reason is that we have a revised Selenium IDE. Years ago, this used to be
Firefox only because it used the XPI extension mechanism (which was specific to Firefox). It’s now a
web component, and you can download it for Chrome, Firefox, and anything else that supports Web
Components. There is currently work to rewrite it as an Electron app, which will allow us to make
better use of the native OS the IDE is running on. That work was largely pushed forward by developers
working at Applitools. They started from a base of the original Selenium IDE that had been migrated
to use Web Components by a company called SideX. It’s been a fantastic example of the community
working together well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, we have fully adopted the W3C WebDriver protocol, and have dropped support for the original
home-grown wire protocol. The way that Selenium communicates with a web browser is via a wire protocol
that’s effectively just JSON over HTTP. Originally this grew organically as we figured things out,
and we tried to make browsers do what we needed them to. That original protocol is known as the JSON
wire protocol because it spoke JSON over the wire (and we’re not great at coming up with very original names).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That original protocol was the base for the W3C WebDriver protocol, which smoothed some of the rough
edges, and brought some much needed consistency to the protocol. The two major areas the standardised
protocol improved on included session creation, where we removed considerable ambiguity, and by providing
a far richer API for specifying user actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what does this adoption of the W3C protocol mean for you? I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest: it probably doesn’t mean
much to you at all. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a modern browser (released over the past couple of years), you will
find that actually you already speak the W3C protocol with Selenium 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So who does care about the protocol dialects? When we talk about companies like Sauce Labs who provide
Selenium as a service—they care about it. The ecosystem is ready for this next step, because the
technical folks at these companies have ensured that they understand and comply with the W3C protocol,
and folks from the Selenium project have been there offering help and advice as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the other nice things about Selenium 4 is that we&amp;rsquo;ve done our best to ensure a stable user-facing
API. That means when you upgrade your project from Selenium 3 to Selenium 4, it should be a drop-in
upgrade. You just change the version number, recompile and you should be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few caveats that you should be aware of, however! The major one is that if in the last version
of Selenium 3 a method was deprecated, it’s now probably gone. We’ve taken the opportunity of a major
version bump to delete them and clean up the behind-the-scenes internals people don’t normally get to see.
If you’re a software developer, you may recognise this as us paying off some of our technical debt :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for the next post, where I’ll go over some new tricks in Selenium 4.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In this new blog series all about the upcoming release of Selenium 4, Simon Stewart will
cover how the Selenium project works, who is involved, how you can get involved, and a
sneak peek at what’s new in Selenium 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As the lead of the Selenium project, I wanted to kick off a new blog series leading up to
the release of Selenium 4. During this series, I’ll talk all about how the Selenium project
works, who is involved, how you—yes, you!—can get involved, and we’ll get a sneak peek at
what’s new in Selenium 4. I&amp;rsquo;ve been speaking about this off and on for a while, but now
the 4.0 release is looming I wanted to start sharing in more depth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this first post, we’ll start off with a brief discussion about how the Selenium project
itself runs and who does what, because that’s a really helpful piece to understand how and
why things happen the way they do on the project. In future posts, we’ll look at the new IDE,
and then we’ll talk about Selenium 4 in more depth, including the fact that it should be a
drop-in replacement for you. I’ll also review some new features that we’ve added to Selenium
4, and talk a bit about the modernized Selenium Grid. So let’s get started!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-the-selenium-project">About the Selenium Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Selenium is an Open Source project. It&amp;rsquo;s run under the aegis of the Software Freedom
Conservancy (SFC). The SFC is a group dedicated to pushing forward Free and Open Source
software. Besides Selenium, they have a handful of projects you may have heard of, including
Samba, Mercurial and Git. The SFC allows us to focus on writing code and fixing bugs by
handling all the legal and financial stuff we’re not good at. They’re the ones that help
us negotiate contracts for when we want to run SeleniumConf, for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Acting as a bridge between the project and the SFC is the Project Leadership Committee
(PLC). Currently, it’s made up of Jim Evans, Alexei Barantsev, Marcus Merrell, Manoj Kumar,
and myself. What do we do? Effectively, the PLC is about providing a smaller group of people
for the SFC to talk to when decisions need to be made about funding a conference, or how
best to respond to sponsorship agreements. Because we like to do as much work in the open
as possible, you can find us on the &lt;code>#selenium-plc&lt;/code> Slack channel, and almost every
conversation and topic is discussed here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the key qualifications for being on the PLC is a demonstrated commitment to helping
the Selenium project improve and succeed, and we recognise that the project is more than just
“code.” It’s a community, and the make up of the PLC reflects that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Technical Leadership Committee (TLC) includes the people who set the technical direction
for the project. If you come over to the Selenium Slack, you can find the &lt;code>#selenium-tlc&lt;/code> channel,
which is where a lot of the technical conversations happen for the project. The TLC includes Jim
Evans, Alexei Barantsev, David Burns, Diego Molina, Titus Fortner, and me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you get on the TLC? Although the project governance document goes into more detail,
it can be summed up as simply as someone who’s demonstrated technical leadership on the project,
over an extended period of time. Just as with the PLC, being on the TLC doesn’t give someone more
authority, but they’re the ones who can merge PRs, and who can (if need be) commit directly to the tree.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, the TLC tries to do as much work as possible in the open. If you’re ever interested in watching
the design discussions, or asking why a bit of the Selenium code base is structured the way it is, then
come and join us in the &lt;code>#selenium-tlc&lt;/code> Slack channel. There’s normally someone from the project there
who’ll be able to answer your questions!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to share how the project works for one simple reason: to highlight one of the really important
things with Open Source, which is that anyone can contribute! You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be throwing code around
in order to be contributing, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-BfM97PZk">you don’t need to be special&lt;/a>
in order to contribute your time and effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So obviously there&amp;rsquo;s the people running the projects and writing code, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t do that all on our own.
Every release includes contributions from a variety of people, not just the core development team. Also, we&amp;rsquo;re
always happy to accept patches. If you&amp;rsquo;re not quite sure where to start, I recommend you head to our
&lt;a href="https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/">GitHub page&lt;/a> and take a look at the project tab. That’s where you
can see the things that need to be done and what we&amp;rsquo;re working on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other way to get involved is the way that everyone used to get involved with Open Source, which is by
what&amp;rsquo;s known as “scratching your own itch”. It&amp;rsquo;s if there&amp;rsquo;s something about the project, something about the
product you think could be a little bit better, download the source, edit it, and then send us a PR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We encourage you to get involved and contribute! On the Selenium website, there is a
&lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/governance/">page&lt;/a> that outlines in detail the steps to join the Selenium team.
Join the Selenium Slack channel to interact with us and ask questions. If you want to discuss something,
or if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand why the code is written the way it is, feel free to come on to that Slack channel
and talk to us. Also, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to see how the decision making is made, then please do feel free to come
on to the &lt;code>#selenium-tlc&lt;/code> or the &lt;code>#selenium-plc&lt;/code> channels to see those groups. Because we&amp;rsquo;re Open Source, we
try and do everything in the open.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’d like to put faces to people’s Slack or IRC handles, then please note that there’s a regular team
meeting every other Thursday on Google Meet at 4:30pm (UK time!) We tend to just chat and discuss everything
from the project to the weather, but that’s a great way to get to know people a little better! :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, if you’re having trouble getting to grips with the Selenium code base, then please do come and ask us
for help. We’ve done our best to make the on-ramp as easy to take as possible, but the project can seem complicated
and daunting when you’re getting started. We’re here to help!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope you enjoyed this intro to the Selenium project. Next week, we’ll talk about why the major version bump to
Selenium 4. Stay tuned!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year where working groups from the W3C meet up to discuss the various standards that
are being worked on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within the Browser Testing and Tools Working Group, there are 2 different standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/">WebDriver&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi">WebDriver-Bidi&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The first is what is commonly supported by the Selenium Project and has support from Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Google in their browsers. It is also supported by various Selenium in the cloud providers like Sauce Labs and BrowserStack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the world has moved on we have felt the need to add new APIs and move Selenium to be more event-driven. This is where we are learning, and collaborating, with projects like Puppeteer to make sure that we can improve the Browser Automation space. This is where the &lt;a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi">WebDriver-Bidi&lt;/a> Specification comes in. It has broad support from the browser vendors so you can use official browsers and not be limited by the JavaScript sandbox. Some of the newer frameworks can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In August of 2017 Simon shared the bleak, hard news that as of Firefox 55 Selenium IDE would no longer work.
Selenium IDE (or as we’ll refer to it from here on out – the Legacy IDE) was, and is, dead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then quite a lot has happened with the IDE. We have a new version of it which we are referring to as… Selenium IDE!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It is currently in “alpha” and available for use in both
&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd">Chrome&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/">Firefox&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In his post Simon also mentioned “the fine people at &lt;a href="https://applitools.com">Applitools&lt;/a>“. This includes Tomer Steinfeld,
Dave Haeffner, and Doron Zavalevsky. Together, along with contributions from the rest of the Selenium community and
the SideeX project, we have been able to get the new Selenium IDE out into the wild. We are also working to close the gap
on feature parity with its predecessor along with adding some much needed enhancements to the tool (more on that in future posts).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’d love for you to give the new IDE a try and let us know what you think. Visit either the
&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd">Chrome Web Store&lt;/a> or
&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/">Firefox Add-ons&lt;/a> to install it. For info on how to
use the tool, you can check out the getting started documentation on Selenium HQ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have any questions you can find us on the &lt;a href="https://selenium.dev/support/">Selenium Slack/IRC chat channel&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Happy Testing!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Firefox 55 and Selenium IDE</title><link>/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The bad news: &lt;strong>from Firefox 55 onwards, Selenium IDE will no longer work&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reasons for this are complex, but boil down to two main causes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Browsers are complicated pieces of software that are constantly evolving. Mozilla has been working hard to make Firefox &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/06/13/faster-better-firefox/">faster and more stable&lt;/a>, while still retaining the flexibility and ease of extension that we’ve come to know and love. As part of that process, Firefox is switching extensions from the original “&lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/">XPI&lt;/a>” format, to a newer, more widely adopted “&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions">Web Extension&lt;/a>” mechanism.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Selenium project lacks someone with the time and energy to move the IDE forwards to take advantage of the new technologies.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium&lt;/a> is one of the most widely used pieces of testing software there is. Despite this, the team of people regularly contributing is small: since the start of the year, there are only 11 people who have made more than 10 commits, with two people accounting for more than half of those. Since 2016, only one person has been maintaining the IDE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Selenium is an Open Source project. None of the core contributors — not the IDE maintainer, not the language binding owners — are paid to work on work on it. They do it because they love working on the code, and they typically do it in their “copious free time”. The IDE maintainer has had almost none of that to spare. We should all be thanking that committer for his time and effort. Thank you, Samit!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what can we do to move forward? The first thing is that there are now a wealth of tools that are stepping up to fill the gap. You should go and have a look at them. The second thing is that there is an effort to rebuild IDE using modern APIs, to be usable across more than just Firefox. The fine people at &lt;a href="https://applitools.com/">Applitools&lt;/a> are helping with this effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third thing? That’s you. &lt;strong>You could help us&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you believe that a friendly UI for quickly recording and playing back tests is a useful Open Source tool, then please come and join us! The main technical discussions are happening on the #selenium IRC channel. If you’d prefer &lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.herokuapp.com/">Slack&lt;/a>, you can join us on that too. Or there’s the ever useful &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-developers">selenium-developers&lt;/a> mailing list. Come onboard. We’d love your help, and IDE is a wonderful thing to contribute to!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Hacking with IntelliJ</title><link>/blog/2017/hacking-with-intellij/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2017/hacking-with-intellij/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">Jetbrains&lt;/a> have a &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/buy/opensource/">programme for Open Source projects&lt;/a> which allows them to receive &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a> licenses. As part of that programme, which the Selenium project has participated in for many years, they’ve asked us to provide a fair and balanced review of IntelliJ. I’ll attempt to do that, and I’ll try and state my biases up-front so you’re aware of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been using Jetbrain’s IntelliJ to hack on the Selenium code since I started working on it slightly over ten years ago. It’s still my favourite IDE for my Java work, and it’s plenty of fun to use. For some time, I’ve been using the (free) Community Edition, which is ample for many coding needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of my work is in Java, and that’s where I know IDEA best. I dabble in Ruby and Python, and I’ve written a reasonably large amount of Javascript, all in IDEA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Pros:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In common with other good IDEs, IDEA has the ability to work seamlessly with many different languages. If you’re a polyglot programmer, being able to stay in the same tool for much of your work makes life a lot easier. On the Selenium project, we use Java, C#, Ruby, Python, and Javascript extensively. I don’t do any C#, and I mainly focus on Java, but the support for JS, Ruby, and Python is lovely and seems to work well. The built in type detection and code navigation features are impressive (particularly for untyped languages such as JS)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, the feature that made IDEA so awesome in the first place is the range of refactoring options it offers. These are great, and always have been. One nice feature I’ve noticed as we move to a Java 8 future (finally!) is that it offers suggestions to help migrate to new features where they make sense (and, I’ll be honest, sometimes when they don’t). It’s made making use of lambdas a lot easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a while, IDEA was becoming slower and more bloated, but I’m pleased to see that, partly thanks to the work of developers from &lt;a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook&lt;/a>, the latest releases feel snappier and handle larger projects more efficiently. One thing I appreciate is how open Jetbrains were to receiving patches to their core product: it displays a level of respect for external contributors that I feel is important (of course, I would think that: I work on OSS for fun!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s a nice wide range of plugins available for IDEA. I’ve hooked up the Buck plugin and made use of it. Without an extensions API, this plugin wouldn’t have been possible, but having them there is incredibly useful and makes the IDE even more capable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally for the plus points of the IDE, I love that the IDE tracks new versions of Java relatively closely — it’s fun to see what new language features we’ll be able to use in the future!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cons:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although it’s a fine product, there are some niggles to be had.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most annoyingly, the built in code analysis doesn’t always warn that some Java classes won’t compile. The most recent example was where IDEA didn’t flag that some lambdas couldn’t be used since the choice of method to use was ambiguous. This may be because the Java language continues its slothful way forward, and the compiler improves with each release — certainly these same files compiled just fine with older Java releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When an error does happen, I’ve yet to find the magic setting to allow IDEA to keep going as far as possible. One of the features I like about Eclipse is that it’ll compile as much as it can, even if there are invalid source files. When doing TDD, this allows you to move just a little bit faster as unit tests can run and pass so long as they don’t touch faulty code. I dearly wish this same capability was present in IDEA!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the Selenium project, we use &lt;a href="http://buckbuild.com/">Buck&lt;/a> for our builds. The Buck plugin doesn’t (yet!) allow me to build and run tests within the IDE, yet Buck performs some steps that can’t be repeated by the IDE that are required for a successful build. IDEA offers the ability to run an &lt;a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant&lt;/a> step before a build is run, and it would be extremely useful if this was generalised to “any shell command”. Most of the time, it’s fine, but it’s irksome to forget to run things!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the whole, I love IntelliJ an awful lot. It’s a fast and capable IDE, and the company behind it supports OSS. What’s not to love?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Selenium 3.0: Out Now!</title><link>/blog/2016/selenium-3-0-out-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2016/selenium-3-0-out-now/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We are very pleased to announce the release of &lt;a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/">Selenium 3.0&lt;/a>. If you’ve been waiting for a stable release since 2.53.1, now’s your chance to update. And if you do, here is what you’ll find:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As &lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2016/10/04/selenium-3-is-coming/">we’ve said before&lt;/a>, for users of the WebDriver APIs this is a drop-in replacement. You’ll find that modern browsers, such as &lt;a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads">Chrome&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/">Edge&lt;/a> will continue to work just as before, and we’ve taken the opportunity to fix some bugs and improve stability. Selenium Grid users may require updates to their configuration as the json config file format has been updated, as have some of command line parameter options, but the upgrade should also be smooth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The major change in Selenium 3.0 is we’re removing the original Selenium Core implementation and replacing it with one backed by WebDriver. This will affect all users of the &lt;a href="http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.html">Selenium RC&lt;/a> APIs. For more information, please see the &lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2016/10/04/selenium-3-is-coming/">previous post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot has changed in the 5 years between versions 2 and 3. When we &lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/selenium-2-0/">shipped Selenium 2&lt;/a>, the Selenium project was responsible for providing the driver for each browser. Now, we are happy to say that all the major browser vendors ship their own implementations (&lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/">Apple&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/">Google&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/">Microsoft&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">Mozilla&lt;/a>). Because the browser vendors know their browsers better than anyone, their WebDriver implementations can be tightly coupled to the browser, leading to a better testing experience for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other notable change has been that there is now a &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">W3C specification&lt;/a> for browser automation, based on the Open Source WebDriver. This has yet to reach “recommendation” status, but the people working on it (including members of the Selenium project!) are now focusing on finishing the text and writing the implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mozilla has been a front-runner in implementing the W3C WebDriver protocol. On the plus side, this has exposed problems with the spec as it has evolved, but it also means that Firefox support is hard to track as their engineering efforts have been forward looking, rather than on supporting the current wire protocol used by Selenium WebDriver. For now, the best advice we can offer is for you to try the latest release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver&lt;/a> and Selenium together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are exciting times for browser automation! Selenium 3.0 is a major release and we’re looking forward to improving things further, as well as tracking the ongoing work of the W3C spec. Our goal is to keep the changes your tests need to deal with to an absolute minimum, to continue preserving the hard work that’s gone into writing your existing tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a personal note, I’d like to say thank you to each of the many people that have worked so hard to make Selenium 3 possible. That’s not just the developers and contributors to the Open Source project (past and present), but also the engineers from Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Apple, and everyone involved with the W3C spec. I’d also like to say thank you to everyone who’s taken the time to report bugs, our users and our community. The project is great fun to work on and you’re the reason for that. A final thank you is due to the Software Freedom Conservancy, who have provided invaluable help with the logistics of running a large OSS project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy hacking, everyone! May your tests run fast and true!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Selenium 3 is Coming</title><link>/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2016/selenium-3-is-coming/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/">Selenium 3&lt;/a> is coming! As I write this, we think that “beta 4” will be the last beta before the official 3.0 release. I’m here to tell you about what’s changed, and what impact this will have on your testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tldr">TL;DR:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>WebDriver users will just find bug fixes and a drop-in replacement for 2.x.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Selenium Grid users will also find bug fixes and a simple update.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The WebDriver APIs are now the only APIs actively supported by the Selenium project.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Selenium RC APIs have been moved to a “legacy” package.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The original code powering Selenium RC has been replaced with something backed by WebDriver, which is also contained in the “legacy” package.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By a quirk of timing, Mozilla have made changes to Firefox that mean that from Firefox 48 you must use their geckodriver to use that browser, regardless of whether you’re using Selenium 2 or 3.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="in-more-depth">In more depth:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When we &lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/selenium-2-0/">released Selenium 2.0&lt;/a> in 2011, we introduced the new WebDriver APIs, and encouraged everyone to start moving to them. If you’re using the WebDriver APIs, then Selenium 3.0 is a simple drop-in upgrade. We’ve not changed any of the public WebDriver APIs, and the code is essentially the same as the last 2.x release. If you’re using Selenium Grid, the same applies: in most cases, you can just drop in the new JAR (or update your maven dependency to 3.0.0), and you’re done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the update to Selenium 3 is such a non-event, why did we call this Selenium 3.0? To answer this question, I first need to provide some history, and tell you a little about how Selenium works under the hood. The very first version of Selenium was “just” a very complicated Javascript framework, running in the browser and interpreting the table-based tests you may be familiar with if you use Selenium IDE. We call this “Selenium Core”. This Javascript framework formed the basis of the original implementation of Selenium RC (the oldest set of Selenium APIs, where all the method and functions were on the “&lt;a href="http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.html">Selenium&lt;/a>” interface, and which have been deprecated for some time now). Over time, the needs of modern web testing have grown ever more complicated and sophisticated, and Selenium Core is now less capable of meeting these needs than it was before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Selenium 3.0, we are deleting the original Selenium Core implementation. If you use the old RC interfaces, we provide an alternative implementation that’s backed by WebDriver. This is the same “webdriver-backed selenium” that has been available as part of Selenium 2 since its release. Because the underlying technology has changed from Selenium Core to WebDriver, you may find some places where your existing tests using RC run into issues. Our experience with migrating suites is that it’s normally a systemic issue that can be fixed with a minimal engineering effort (that is, the problem is normally isolated to a few places, and these can be rewritten to avoid problems)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’re also removing the original Selenium RC APIs from the main downloads. If you’re a Java user, and need to use them to support existing tests, then you’ll need a dependency to “org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-leg-rc:3.0.0” (or later!). It’s strongly recommended that you do not do this unless you absolutely need to.&lt;br>
If you’re someone who runs tests exported from IDE in the table format, there is now a new test runner that the project has made available for you to use that can be &lt;a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/">downloaded&lt;/a> from the project’s website. It takes the same arguments as the old runner, and we’ve done our best to ensure the output of tests remains the same too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time as the Selenium project is shipping Selenium 3.0, Mozilla are changing the internals of Firefox in a way that makes it more stable and secure, but which also makes the community provided Firefox Driver no longer work. As such, if you use Firefox for your testing, you’ll need to use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver&lt;/a>, which is an executable similar to the &lt;a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/">chromedriver&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/">Microsoft WebDriver&lt;/a> for Edge. You’ll need to start using geckodriver even if you’re using Selenium 2 — the change is in the browser, not Selenium. Please be aware that geckodriver is alpha software, based on the evolving W3C WebDriver standard: everyone’s working flat out to give you the best testing experience they can, but there are undoubtedly some bumps in the road when it comes to testing with Firefox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release marks the culmination of a lot of hard work by the Selenium committers and community. I’d like to thank everyone who has been part of this process, and the Selenium users around the world who have done so much to make the project as successful as it is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Announcing Selenium 3.0-beta1</title><link>/blog/2016/announcing-selenium-3-0-beta1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2016/announcing-selenium-3-0-beta1/</guid><description>
&lt;p>At SeleniumConf in 2013, we announced that a new major version of Selenium would be released “by Christmas”. Fortunately, we never said which Christmas, as it has taken us a while to make all the changes we wanted to make! We’re excited to announce the release of the first beta — Selenium 3.0.0-beta1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’d love you to try it out on your projects, and provide us with feedback on where the rough edges are before we ship the 3.0 itself! Please remember that this is a beta release, so your feedback is incredibly helpful and valuable in order to help us smooth any rough edges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the last six years we’ve been advising users to switch to the newer WebDriver APIs and to stop using the original RC APIs. With Selenium 3.0, the original implementation of RC has been removed, replaced by one that sits on top of WebDriver. For many users, this change will go completely unnoticed, as they’re no longer using the RC APIs. For those of you who still are, we’ve done our best to make the change as smooth as possible, but &lt;a href="https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/issues">we welcome high quality bug reports&lt;/a> to help us fix any problems that occur. Maven users will need to add a dependency on the new “&lt;a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/maven.jsp">leg-rc&lt;/a>” package to access the old RC APIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some other changes that you might need to be aware of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You’ll need to be running Java 8&lt;/strong> to use the Java pieces of Selenium. This is the oldest version of Java officially supported by Oracle, so hopefully you’re using it already!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support for Firefox is via Mozilla’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">geckodriver&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support for Safari is provided on macOS (Sierra or later) via Apple’s own &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_10_0.html">safaridriver&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support for Edge is provided by MS through their &lt;a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/">webdriver server&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only versions 9 or above of IE are supported. Earlier versions may work, but are no longer supported as &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support">MS no longer supports them&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We’ll be posting more information about Selenium 3.0 to this blog soon, but until then if you’re interested in learning more then &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bistojJPR98">a recent webinar by Simon&lt;/a> is a great place to start.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: IntelliJ</title><link>/blog/2015/intellij/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2015/intellij/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Every year, Jetbrains are kind enough to donate an OSS license for IntelliJ to the Selenium project. As part of that process, they’ve asked that we review the product and (kudos to them!) have been clear that they hope we’re open and honest. So, I’ll be open and honest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I tell people that I’m a professional Java developer, people in some circles make sympathetic noises and (sometimes) jokingly refer to how painful my coding life must be. After all, there are several far trendier and hipper languages, from Ruby, various flavours of Javascript, Python, Haskell, and even other languages running on the JVM such as Scala and Clojure. I tend to agree that Java is a relatively unexciting language as it’s generally practiced — Java 8 contains a wealth of goodies that lots of people won’t be using for years since they’ve still got to support Java 6(!) apps. Where I disagree with the detractors is that using Java is something to feel sorry for a developer for: Java on its own isn’t much fun, Java and IntelliJ is one of my favourite programming experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been using Java since the (very) late 90s, and have been using IntelliJ off-and-on since 2003 or so. In the intervening just-over-a-decade, what started as a tool that crossed the Rubicon of “being able to do refactoring” has matured. It has literally changed the way I write code: I now use the “Introduce Variable” refactoring to avoid needing to do initial assignments of values to variables as a matter of course. Indeed, with IntelliJ, I frequently stop thinking about the programming language and start thinking about the structure of the solution. Its refactorings make exploring large scale changes easy and entirely reliable, and once the restructurings are complete, I can jump to symbols with ease.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code exploration is aided by the simple and quick ways IntelliJ can find usages, and it’s simple to find unused code as method declarations get highlighted in a different shade to used ones. The integrated debugger is sufficiently capable that, coupled with unit tests, it’s normally pretty easy to figure out why some odd behaviour is happening. And, speaking of unit tests, the UI is clear and (I find) intuitive and easy to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And those users of fancy-pants languages such as Clojure, Ruby, Python and Javascript (and PHP) can get plugins that extend IntelliJ’s capabilities and insight into those languages. Although it’s been a long time since I’ve had to deal with Spring and JEE, when I do IJ has my back, grokking the config files. The maven and gradle integration appears to work too, though Selenium uses CrazyFun and is migrating to Buck, so I’ve seldom any need to&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s not all wonder and joy. On large, multi-module codebases, IntelliJ seems to spend too long building caches. Activity Monitor on the Mac suggests it’s doing this in a single threaded manner, which is wasteful on a multicored machine. Switching away from IJ, doing something on the command line involving source control and then switching back is a sure-fire way to make it rebuild the caches, making it unresponsive. Extending IntelliJ by writing plugins is a black art — the documentation is scattered and appears out of date, making getting started on writing one hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, though, I love IntelliJ. On the Selenium project, it’s the IDE of choice, and I’ve been incredibly productive in it. Thank you, Jetbrains, for a wonderful tool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Android and iOS Support</title><link>/blog/2013/android-and-ios-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2013/android-and-ios-support/</guid><description>
&lt;p>TL;DR: We’re retiring Selenium’s own AndroidDriver and iPhoneDriver in favour of any of &lt;a href="http://selendroid.io/">Selendroid&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/">iosdriver&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://appium.io/">Appium&lt;/a>. If you’re using one of Selenium’s own mobile drivers, please evaluate one of these alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The longer version:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2007, Steve Jobs &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09Apple-Reinvents-the-Phone-with-iPhone.html">announced the iPhone&lt;/a> and changed the mobile Web from a curiosity to something the mainstream wanted and used. Current trends suggest that mobile Web usage will surpass desktop usage in the not too distant future. Which is a long way of saying the mobile Web is going to be a big part of the future of your sites and that it’d be an extremely wise idea to test them on mobile devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Selenium project responded to the rise of the mobile web by working to produce WebDriver implementations for both iOS and Android. The first lines of the iPhoneDriver (which also worked on the iPad) were added to the project early in 2009. The AndroidDriver was added in June 2010, and was primarily developed by engineers at Google. To this day you can download the official Android SDK and find “&lt;a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/10/introducing-android-webdriver.html">Google WebDriver&lt;/a>” as one of the optional extras you can download.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the initial work on the mobile drivers, something interesting happened. Experimental extensions and modifications to the drivers were made outside of the selenium project. The first one of these that I was involved with was “&lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/nativedriver/">nativedriver&lt;/a>“. This took the novel approach of allowing users to interact with the native UI of the phone, be it Android or iOS, using the familiar WebDriver APIs. The first time I saw it, I thought it was madness, but the engineers working on it soon convinced me that it made sense. And guess what? They were right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sadly, after proving the idea was viable and workable, the NativeDriver project ran out of steam, but it set the scene for three projects that have taken the idea and run with it to create remarkably capable pieces of mobile testing software: Selendroid, iosdriver and Appium. All three of these allow a tester familiar with the WebDriver APIs to test mobile apps on iOS and Android. Not only native ones, but also hybrid or pure web-based ones too. They’ve recently been joined by the &lt;a href="http://winphonewebdriver.codeplex.com/">Windows Phone WebDriver&lt;/a>, which allows testing of mobile web apps on WinPhone 8.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of these projects have something in common: they’re far more active, more capable and have pushed further than the equivalent code in the main selenium project. In fact, some of the members of the selenium team that contributed to both AndroidDriver and iPhoneDriver are now also working on those other projects. There’s &lt;a href="http://sauceio.com/index.php/2013/09/the-mobile-json-wire-protocol-workshop/">work being done&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse?repo=mobile">maintain interoperability&lt;/a> between the different drivers, allowing users to chose which framework is most appropriate for their needs without fear of their tests needing major rework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means that keeping the existing Android and iPhone drivers within the Selenium project isn’t helping our users. The alternatives are better, and keeping “official” drivers within the project muddies the water. Worse, the selenium developers are slow at making fixes to those drivers, which is incredibly frustrating for everyone involved. Because of this, the Selenium project has deleted the code for those drivers from its repository and we recommend you evaluate and use one of the alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, the code will still live in our repo’s history, so if you’d like to build them yourself, then it’s still possible. The last version with the iPhoneDriver is &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=ef9d5787e5e136ecb4a31b0cf53a1fd17e252cf3">ef9d578&lt;/a>, and the last one with the Android source is &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=00a3c7df9fb4109e1f99b5f7bee5f5df74fb876a">00a3c7d&lt;/a>. We’ve uploaded a version of the AndroidDriver built from that revision to the downloads page to save you having to do so yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These changes do not mean that we don’t support mobile as a project. It just means that we support the best implementations of mobile WebDriver, and those aren’t written as part of the Selenium project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Mobile WebDriver</title><link>/blog/2013/mobile-webdriver/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2013/mobile-webdriver/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Although the WebDriver APIs started life as just a mechanism for automating web browsers, over the past few years it has been extended to also work on mobile devices. Projects such as Appium, iosdriver, and Selendroid have all shown that this approach works, and works well. On the Web, if you start using Selenium WebDriver with one browser (Firefox, for example), it’s easy to switch out the browser for another one (such as Internet Explorer or Chrome). It’d be nice to have a similar option for mobile, switching from one automation framework for Android to another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of the Selenium 3 work, we have started working on a test suite to help ensure this level of interop between &lt;a href="http://appium.io/">appium&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/">iosdriver&lt;/a>, and appium and &lt;a href="http://selendroid.io/">selendroid&lt;/a>. To kick start the process, the primary authors of each of those tools, as well as others including David Burns representing the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Marionette">Marionette&lt;/a> project (Mozilla’s implementation of WebDriver for Firefox and Firefox OS) and Simon Stewart, the lead of the &lt;a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium&lt;/a> project, have spent the past two days locked in a small room in Mozilla HQ, London. They’ve taken this time to work out the areas where each of their projects didn’t align and agreed on a way to ensure a level of interoperability. There was only a minimal quantity of blood and tears, but plenty of hard work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rnE13aGCaRiri01hti7j1jWDuPvQHT8aao4bHhEGz8Y/edit">agenda&lt;/a> for the past two days can be found here, and the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yXXsQo3z7lUVl3ZthAx39h4xBlF62x7q_NZd3NA9jnU/edit">minutes&lt;/a> are also available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we speak, work has started on a shared test suite, hosted in a &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout?repo=mobile">repo&lt;/a> in the selenium project’s Google Code page. Please, feel free to come along and join in!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: The Road to Selenium 3</title><link>/blog/2013/the-road-to-selenium-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2013/the-road-to-selenium-3/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Selenium 2 was &lt;a href="http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/selenium-2-0/">released in July 2011&lt;/a>. It’s now two years old, and what a couple of years it’s been! The WebDriver APIs, which were the major addition in Selenium 2, are now the basis for a &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">W3C standard&lt;/a>, and there are implementations written and supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera. There have been 34 releases, with official support for Java, C#, Python, Ruby and Javascript, and the community has stepped in to provide bindings for Perl, PHP and others. There have been 57 different people authoring changes in the code base, and countless more participating in the online forums, offering help and advice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While all this has been happening, the world has moved on, and now it’s time for the Selenium project to look to the future. It’s with great pleasure that I can now say that we’re working towards Selenium 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We aim for Selenium 3 to be “a tool for user-focused automation of mobile and web apps”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does this mean? For mobile users, the Selenium project will be hosting a suite of tests to facilitate interoperability between the many different projects available that are extending the WebDriver API to also cope with mobile. Developers from projects such as &lt;a href="http://appium.io/">Appium&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/">ios-driver&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://selendroid.io/">selendroid&lt;/a> will be working on the suite of tests to enable this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ll also be working on making the technology behind Selenium as stable and capable as possible. For this reason, Selenium 3 will see the removal of the original Selenium Core implementations, and consequently we’ll be deprecating the RC APIs too. The old versions will still be available as a separate download, but active development will cease, except for very urgent fixes. We will still be providing an implementation of the RC APIs backed by WebDriver, so you can continue running your existing tests, but now would be a great time to make the move to using the WebDriver APIs directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those of you exporting your tests from IDE and running the HTML suites, we’ll provide an alternative runner that allows you to continue running those tests too, though it’ll be backed by the same “WebDriver-backed” RC implementation as offered by the main download. Again, the original implementation will be available as a download, but it will no longer be actively developed once we release 3.0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our current plan is to start shipping 3.0 by Christmas this year: it’s going to be a lot of fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: A Smattering of Selenium #157</title><link>/blog/2013/a-smattering-of-selenium-157/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2013/a-smattering-of-selenium-157/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Almost a month after the last one. Though it did nice to have it at 150 when people go to the blog … but a greater number is nicer.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>So I was trying to find &lt;a href="http://requests.ryanmccue.info/">Requests for PHP&lt;/a> whilst talking to &lt;a href="http://grumpy-phpunit.com/">the grumpy programmer&lt;/a> and he pointed me out to &lt;a href="http://guzzlephp.org/index.html">Guzzle&lt;/a> which looks equally cool&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com.au/2013/06/can-you-optimize-listgenexp.html">Can you optimize list(genexp)&lt;/a> is one of those geeky language internals things that could be handy to have in your back pocket&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/CHH/phpenv">phpenv&lt;/a> could be useful. And could be I mean ‘holy crap this is useful’ — but then again, I do actually need 3 different versions of PHP locally. YMMV&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://oneandonemakesthreeright.blogspot.be/2013/06/pain-killing-pingpongers-decease.html">Pain killing the pingponger’s decease&lt;/a> is by their own admission not stable, but is a nice temporary solution. And illustrates why you should learn your tools — if they didn’t know about custom annotations and their runners in JUnit they would have missed this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yet another JS testing framework has grown a webdriver tentacle – &lt;a href="https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-webdriver-launcher">karma-webdriver-launcher&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I barely understand a word of &lt;a href="https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2012/08/method-decorators-and-combinators-in-coffeescript.md#method-combinators-in-coffeescript">Method Combinators in CoffeeScript&lt;/a> which is often a sign I should include something&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://bigqueri.es/t/how-are-javascript-files-being-served-and-how-many-are-there/36">How are JavaScript files being served and how many are there?&lt;/a> is interesting … even if I don’t understand what/where he has put all this HAR information so one could reproduce this on their one data&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Remember I said I should just auto-include all of Raymond Hettinger’s SO answers? Well, here’s another one – &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17006127/python-importing-class-attributes-into-method-local-namespace/17006268#17006268">Python importing class attributes into method local namespace&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://storyautomation.com/">storyautomation&lt;/a> seems to have a number of decent posts. Of course, they are around RC so I was hesitant to link to it, but it looks like the ideas could transpose up to WebDriver&lt;/li>

&lt;div>The support policy of the &lt;a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">selenium project&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox&lt;/a> browsers is to support the current and previous stables releases, as well as the current and previous &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/">ESR&lt;/a> releases. At the time of writing, that means the supported versions are &amp;#8220;10&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;17&amp;#8221; (ESR) and &amp;#8220;17&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;18&amp;#8221; (stable channel). In addition to this, we are currently supporting Firefox 3.x too.&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>This is an official announcement that we are planning to end support for Firefox 3.x in the near future in RC, WebDriver and Core/IDE, and this is your chance to be involved in that decision. Unless there is a strong reason to do otherwise, I shall shortly be announcing a timeline for the end of the support of 3.x&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>Once support for Firefox 3.x is removed, the earliest supported Firefox version will be the ESR-1 release (currently Firefox 10).&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>Rationale:&lt;/div>
&lt;div>Firefox 3.x is no longer actively supported by &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla&lt;/a>, and this has been the case since &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2012/03/23/upcoming-firefox-support-changes/">April 24, 2012&lt;/a>. Since this time, 3.x has dropped to under 1% of global Web traffic (0.62% at the time of writing according to StatCounter) Continued focus on supporting an effectively dead browser prevents the selenium team from using features in the newer releases for little benefit to you.&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>Continued support of Firefox 3.x by the selenium project gives the impression that that particular version is still a valid option used by the population of the Web. This is simply not the case, and it may mean that testers efforts are being spent fixing problems that almost no users will ever see.&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>What you can do:&lt;/div>
&lt;div>If you agree that this is the right choice, then you do not need to do anything. If you disagree strongly and have the numbers to back up your position, particularly if you can help work on Firefox 3.x support, then please reply to the &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/selenium-users/3l5ZW-LMC7Y">selenium-user google group&lt;/a>.&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>On a personal note, I know that a lot of you may well have firefox 3.x support in your test plans and will be distressed by this plan. Please take the time to look at actual usage logs from your sites and applications to verify that continued support is worth your time and energy before responding. I&amp;#8217;d really appreciate that.&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Blog: A Smattering of Selenium #138</title><link>/blog/2013/a-smattering-of-selenium-138/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2013/a-smattering-of-selenium-138/</guid><description>
